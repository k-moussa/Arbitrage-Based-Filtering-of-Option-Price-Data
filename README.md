# Arbitrage-Based-Filtering-of-Option-Price-Data
A Python reference implementation that was used to generate the plots in the paper "Arbitrage-Based Filtering of Option Price Data." 

To convert implied volatilities to European call prices and back, we use Peter JÃ¤ckel's method proposed in the paper "Let's Be Rational", for which I have gratefully used the implementation in "https://github.com/vollib/py_lets_be_rational/tree/master/py_lets_be_rational"; the implementation mentioned is added in this repository because the filtering procedure depends on it.
